# DotNetVersionCheck
A simple Console Application that outputs all installed .NET Framework and .NET Core Versions

.NET Framework Versions are determined using the Code Samples provided on MSDN:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed

.NET Core Versions are determined using the built-in Console Command:  
dotnet --info

# To Do
- Consider new console commands: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/how-to-detect-installed-versions?pivots=os-windows
- Make available as cli command without clicking .exe
